# Active Learning for Classifying 2D Grid-Based Level Completability

In this project, we propose the use of active learning for learning level completability classification.
Through an active learning approach, we train deep-learning models to classify the completability of generated levels for Super Mario Bros., Kid Icarus, and a Zelda-like game.
